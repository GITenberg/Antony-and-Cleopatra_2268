description: CLASSIC FICTION (PRE C 1945). Hugely ambitious in its historical focus
  and vast geographical scope, Antony and Cleopatra is one of Shakespeare's most astonishing
  tragedies. The drama centres on the relationships between his main protagonists,
  Octavius Ceasar, Mark Antony and Cleopatra, and the highly charged affair between
  Mark Antony and the Egyptian queen that forms the backdrop to the pervading theme
  of struggle between East and West throughout the play. The internal battle of personal
  emotion and duty that Antony experiences, and the dynamics of power and sexuality
  portrayed by Cleopatra, give the play its dramatic tension. Rich and complex in
  its language and poetic in tone, Shakespeare shows how the politics of Rome ultimately
  cause disaster for a man who is torn between reason and passion.
